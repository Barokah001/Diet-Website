        <h3>What is BMI?</h3>

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value calculated using a personâ€™s weight and height. It is a simple screening tool that helps categorize individuals into different weight statuses, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

Health Awareness: BMI offers a quick assessment of whether your weight is in a healthy range for your height. <br>
Disease Risk: Knowing your BMI can indicate potential risks for weight-related conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. <br>
Lifestyle Adjustments: It serves as a starting point for setting realistic health and fitness goals.
</p>
<h3>How Can BMI Help Manage Overall Health?</h3>
<p>
Tracking Progress: By monitoring changes in BMI, you can gauge the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications such as improved diet or increased physical activity. <br>
Guiding Recommendations: Health professionals often use BMI alongside other metrics to tailor dietary and fitness plans for individuals. <br>
